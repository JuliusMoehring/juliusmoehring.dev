            <Paragraph>
                I'm Julius, a software engineer based in the west of Germany. I used to be working mostly as a frontend
                engineer, but currently I'm shifting my focus to become a data scientist. Before I got into software
                engineering, I trained young jumpers and brought them into the sport.
